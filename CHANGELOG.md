## Unreleased

### Behaviour changes

- **Utilities, pipeline wrappers and generator bodies no longer block the host.**
  On CUDA they used to call a global `wp.synchronize()` after their launches. They now only
  enqueue work on the device's current Warp stream. This covers `query()` / `update()` /
  `reset()` / `sample()` / `bake()` / `refresh()` on every utility, `Course.step()` /
  `reset()`, every `warp_pipeline` / `warp_gate` / `warp_relax` wrapper, and every
  generator's pipeline body.
  - Unchanged: consumers on the same stream, `wp.array.numpy()` (a blocking copy), and torch
    on its legacy default stream still see finished results, because Warp streams are created
    blocking.
  - **Action needed:** a consumer on a different stream (for example a torch side stream or
    a simulator's own stream) must order itself explicitly, e.g. with `wp.synchronize_device()`
    or a recorded `wp.Event`. Benchmarks must synchronize before reading a timer.
  - All of these calls can now be recorded into a caller's CUDA graph without any flag.
  - Debugging aid: `TRACKGEN_DEBUG_SYNC=1` makes every library call block on its stream
    again, so asynchronous CUDA errors surface at the call that caused them. It is skipped
    while the stream (or a Warp capture on the device) is capturing; do not combine it with a
    foreign capture on another stream, which it cannot detect.
  - Not changed yet: `TrackGenerator.generate()`, `GateGenerator.generate()` and
    `Course.generate()` keep their self-capture and blocking sync on CUDA.
- **`track_gen.set_capturing()` is deprecated** and is now a no-op that emits a
  `DeprecationWarning`. It will be removed in 1.0. The private `runtime._CAPTURING`,
  `warp_pipeline._CAPTURING` and `warp_gate._CAPTURING` names stay defined but are always
  `False` and are no longer read. `warp_relax.xpbd_solve_inplace` / `band_l0_inplace` accept
  and ignore `capturing=`. `warp_pipeline._sync` / `_init` and `warp_gate._sync` / `_init`
  remain importable for generator plugins.
- **The N_max truncation warning only fires in allocating mode.** `resample_constant_spacing`
  no longer reads `count` back to the host when it is given preallocated buffers (the pipeline
  path), so `TrackGenerator.generate()` on CPU no longer emits the `RuntimeWarning` when a
  track hits `N_max`. Size `N_max >= max(perimeter) / spacing + 1`.

### Packaging

- `warp-lang` is pinned to `>=1.14,<2`.

### Testing

- New `.github/workflows/tests.yml`. The CPU lane runs on every PR
  (`pytest -m "not cuda and not slow and not benchmark"`, warp-lang 1.14.0 and latest).
  The GPU lane (`pytest -m cuda` with `TRACKGEN_REQUIRE_CUDA=1`) needs a self-hosted runner
  and is off until the `TRACKGEN_GPU_RUNNER` repository variable is set to `true`.
- CUDA tests are gated by the `cuda` marker on `wp.is_cuda_available()` (`tests/conftest.py`),
  replacing the `torch.cuda.is_available()` checks that silently skipped them on CPU-only
  torch builds. With `TRACKGEN_REQUIRE_CUDA=1`, a skipped `cuda` test fails the session.
- `tests/test_no_host_sync.py` drives every hot path on CPU with `wp.synchronize*` and
  `wp.array.numpy` replaced by tripwires, and checks that every pipeline wrapper is driven.
